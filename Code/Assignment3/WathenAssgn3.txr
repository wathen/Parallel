CS 521 - Assignment 3

1a) See functions logistic_cuda(), logistic_ref(), logistic() and main() in file Assgn3.cu
1b) From timing results I observe roughly 13 Gflops.
1c) Not knowing C or C++ beforehand meant that the cuda implementation was particularly tricky. I'm not sure that my implementation is 100% correct at this point so my comments on efficiency seem fairly invalid.

2a) See the other function in Assgn3.cu.
2b) From timing results I observe roughly 77 gigabytes per second
2c) Again with 1c this is hard for me to comment on. The use of "strides" when vectors were longer than 1024^2 caused me great headaches on the implementation front.

3a) See file Assgn3_q3.cu
3b) See file Assgn3_q3.cu
3c) Running the code produces roughly 30,000,000 random number a second
3d) I am not really sure how the random state works...
