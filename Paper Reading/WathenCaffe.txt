1. What problem does the paper address?

The paper looks at the software Caffe which is a deep learning framework. A key motivation is large-scale visual recognition.

2. What is the key insight/idea in the paper's solution to this problem?

The idea of this paper is to create a software package (Caffe) that handles recognition type problems. They package utilises CUDA on the GPU and has near-complete bindings for Python and MATLAB.

3. What did the authors do to demonstrate their claims? (e.g. implement a tool, present a proof, run simulations, etc.)

The package has been tested on a number of different recognition type problems, namely object classification, learning semantic features and object detection.

4. Is the support for the claims convincing? Why or why not?

In the first six months, Caffe has been used in a number of research projects both at UC Berkeley (where it was developed) and a number of other universities. It has also been used by industrial partners such as Facebook and Adobe.
