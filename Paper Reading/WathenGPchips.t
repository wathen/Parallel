1. What problem does the paper address?

The paper looks at the performance and energy cost in a general-purpose procissing systems. They look at CPU on specialised systems for H.264.

2. What is the key insignt/idea in the paper's solution to this problem?

The idea is to achieve ASCI-like energy effiencies by creating large and very specialised functional unit that has the ability to execute hundreds of operations per instruction.

3. What did the authors do to demonstrate their claims? (e.g. implement a tool, present a proof, run simulations, etc.)

The authors present the experimental procedure go an H.264 implemenation on a Tesilica CMP. They summarise the specific customisations to their systme. Using their numerical results, they descibe possible applications for such a procedure.

4. Is the support for the claims convincing? Why or why not?

The highely custimised hardware does seem to get close to ASIC like performance but since I did not understand this paper then I cannot comment futher.

5. What are your questions or other comments about the paper?

As with the MapReduce paper, I found this very hard to read. Since I am in the SCL lab then the terminology and base understanding is generally behond me.
