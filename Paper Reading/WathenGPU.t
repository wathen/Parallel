1. What problem does the paper address?

This paper looks at the development of the GPUs at NVIDIA. Specifically it looks at their new Fermi GPU released in 2009.

2. What is the key insignt/idea in the paper's solution to this problem?

The is not really a key insight to the paper's solution of this problem. It does go through, in detail, Fermi GPU. The author discusses the general architecture, cache memory hierarchy and ECC memory protection.

3. What did the authors do to demonstrate their claims? (e.g. implement a tool, present a proof, run simulations, etc.)

With respect to demonstrating their claims, the paper discusses the performance of several applications. These applications vary from Quantum Chemistry, fluid dynamics, Bioinformatics to computational modeling.

4. Is the support for the claims convincing? Why or why not?

Their claims seem to be convincing. They report of specific applications of up to a speedup of 137 times and an average speedup of 72.

5. What are your questions or other comments about the paper?

It seems to me that we are just at the start of GPU computing. There is a whole host of applications that maybe benefit from GPU computing. To my knowledge, in scientific computing, there are very few general purpose software packages available. Many scientific computing applications and methods are highly parallelizable so greater understanding and development in CUDA could be highly useful.
