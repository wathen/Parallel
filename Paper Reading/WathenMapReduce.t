The paper introduces the idea of of MapReduce - a model which allows parallel execution of task on multiple machines.

The problem the paper looks at is how to efficiently analyse huge amounts of data on a distributed system. Such large problems occour in a daily basis within Google.

The main contribution is the implemenation of the MapReduce model. The impementation seems much easier to understand than previous models. This ease and flexibility makes it very attractive for people that need to deal with large amounts of data.

They have shown how the implememnation of the MapReduce model has been picked up and used from a number of different programmers. They reported an increase of roughly 400 people using there source code from early 03 to March 06.

I found it particularly hard to read this paper. This is likely due to me not understanding much of the terminology and my dyslexia. However, the improvements made (in this paper) seem particularly benificial.
